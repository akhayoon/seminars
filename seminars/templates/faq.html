  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>
        How do I browse only combinatorics talks?
      </h4>
      <p> On the <a href="{{ url_for("index") }}">Browse</a> page,
        in the text "Filter by topic", click "topic" to open the topics menu,
        press "Clear all" (if necessary) to deselect all topics,
        click on "combinatorics",
        and adjust the "Filter by topic" slider to the right.
        You can also select more than one topic.
        To close the topics menu, click "topic" again.</p>
    </li>
    
     <li>
      <h4>
        What time zone is used to display talk times?
      </h4>
       <p>
         <i>Your</i> time zone, displayed at the upper right.
         <ul>
           <li>If you're logged in, this is the time zone associated with your account, which you can set on the Account page.</li>
           <li>If you're not logged in, this is the time zone provided by your browser.</li>
         </ul><br>
         Exception (for organizers and speakers): When editing a seminar or talk, times are displayed in the time zone <i>of the seminar or talk</i>; this time zone can be set at the seminar's "Edit properties" page or the talk's "Edit talk" page, respectively.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>
        What should I do if I cannot connect to an online talk?  What if I need a link or password that is not listed?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Check the seminar's external webpage, usually reachable by clicking
        "External homepage" at the seminar's page on this site.  Many seminars post
        passwords just before each talk starts or email them to users subscribed to their
        mailing list.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are still having trouble, contact one of the seminar's scientific organizers; you may need to go to the external webpage to find their contact details.

      <h4>
        What are the benefits of <a href="{{ url_for('user.register') }}">registering</a>?
      </h4>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Registered users can save seminars and talks to their favorites.
            Then on the <a href="{{ url_for("index") }}">Browse</a> page 
            they can click "Show only saved events" to display only those.
            Moreover, on the Account page, they can export these to their own calendars.
          </li>
          <li>
            Registered users can view all livestream links for connecting online to a talk.  
            (Many livestream links are viewable to all, but some seminar organizers may restrict access to registered users.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Registered users, once endorsed, can create their own seminars and conferences for others to see.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </li>

  <li>
      <h4>
        Will my email address be displayed on the site if I register?
      </h4>
      <p>No.  The only situation in which we would display your email publicly is if you list yourself as an organizer of a seminar <i>and</i> indicate that your name should be displayed <i>and</i> do not provide a homepage URL (if your email address and homepage URL are both provided, we would display only the URL), or if similarly you list yourself as maintainer of an institution without providing your homepage URL as a way for people to contact you.  Another situation in which your email address might be shared in a very limited way: Independently of whether you register, if a seminar organizer enters your email address when scheduling a talk by you, then the email address would be visible also to other organizers of that seminar.</p>
    </li>

  <li>
      <h4>
        Can I register an alias email address for a group of organizers, like <span style="font-family:'Lucida Console' ,monospace">prob_seminar@mit.edu</span>?
      </h4>
    <p>No.  Our policy is that each registered user must be a <i>person</i>.  
      What you should do is register as yourself, 
      and then list <span style="font-family:'Lucida Console' ,monospace">prob_seminar@mit.edu</span> 
      as an organizer when you create your seminar.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

    <h2>
  Exporting favorites to a calendar
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>
        If I export seminars to my Google calendar, do I have to export them again every week to see the latest talks?
      </h4>
      <p> No, once you export a seminar to your calendar, talks added to that seminar later will be pushed to your calendar automatically!</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h4>
        I exported my favorites to a calendar.  Why is it showing no events?
      </h4>
      <p>Some calendar services sync external calendars only every 24 hours.  Furthermore, some may take even longer for the initial sync.  A workaround is to go to the <a href="{{ url_for('user.info')}}">Account</a> page, copy the URL of the "ICS file" link there, and add it manually to your calendar app.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h2>
  Endorsed users
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>
        What is the difference between a registered user and an endorsed user?
      </h4>
      <p>Endorsed users have additional privileges:
        <ol><li>They can make their newly created seminars visible to others.</li>
          <li>They can add institutions to the site, so that seminars can be later associated with them.</li>
          <li>They can endorse other users.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
    </li>

   <li>
      <h4>
        How do I get endorsed?
      </h4>
     <p>After <a href="{{ url_for('user.register') }}">registering</a>, go to the <a href="{{ url_for('user.public_users') }}">list of public users</a> and follow the instructions there.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>
        How can I endorse other users?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Once you are endorsed yourself, 
        click on the <a href="{{ url_for('user.info')}}">Account</a> tab, 
        scroll down to "Endorse someone to add content", 
        enter the email address of the person you would like to endorse, 
        and click "Endorse".
        Make an effort to verify beforehand that the email address is associated with 
        someone who would be adding appropriate content (generally mathematicians or mathematics department staff).

  Creating and organizing seminars

      <h4>
        How do I create a new seminar?
      </h4>
      <p><ol><li><a href="{{ url_for('user.register') }}">Register</a> for an account.</li>
     <li>Get your account <a href="{{ url_for('user.public_users') }}">endorsed</a>.  
       (We require this for your seminars to be visible to others, as a security measure, to prevent spam on our site.)</li>
      <li>(Optional, but recommended) Go to the <a href="{{ url_for('list_institutions')}}">Institutions</a> page 
        to make sure that the institutions associated with your seminar are there; if not, add them.  
        (Alternatively, add them after the seminar is created.)</li>
          <li>Click on the <a href="{{ url_for('create.index')}}">Create</a> tab and follow the instructions there.  (Note: After creating your first seminar, the "Create" tab will be renamed as "Manage".)</li>
        </ol></p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>
        How do I create a new conference?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The procedure is the same as for creating a new seminar.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>
        My seminar uses <span style="font-family:'Lucida Console' ,monospace">prob_seminar@mit.edu</span> as an alias email address for reaching all the organizers.  How do I make this appear as a contact email for my seminar?
      </h4>
      <p>
        First, do <i>not</i> register a user account with email address <span style="font-family:'Lucida Console' ,monospace">prob_seminar@mit.edu</span>; 
        our policy is that each registered user must be a <i>person</i>.
        Instead, when editing the seminar properties, in the list of organizers at the bottom, 
        fill in a new row with email address <span style="font-family:'Lucida Console' ,monospace">prob_seminar@mit.edu</span> 
        and uncheck "Organizer" and check "Display".  
        You must also add yourself or some other (human) registered user as an organizer, along with name and email address, 
        and check "Display"; if you also provide a homepage URL, this person's email address will not be displayed.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>
        Is it OK to add a seminar if I'm not one of the organizers?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The seminar organizers will likely be grateful for the assistance in spreading the word about their seminar.
        We suggest notifying them that you plan to add their seminar to this site.
        When entering the seminar details, uncheck the "Organizer" checkbox to the right of your name;
        if you then check "Display", the seminar page will list you as a curator instead of an organizer,
        and the organizers (or others) will be able to contact you if there are any errors.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>
        If someone else added my seminar to the site, how can I gain the ability to update it?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Hopefully that person contacted you or left contact information on the seminar page.
        If so, ask that person to endorse you and to add you to the list of organizers of the seminar; then you can edit it.
        If you don't want the seminar listed on this site, please ask <a href="mailto:edgarc@mit.edu">Edgar Costa</a> or <a href="mailto:roed@mit.edu">David Roe</a> to remove it.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>
        Is it possible to create a draft of a schedule that is only visible to organizers?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Yes.  When you create or edit a seminar, you can set its visibility to one of three options: <i>public</i> (it will appear on the front page and in search results), <i>unlisted</i> (it will not be listed but will be accessible with a direct link) and <i>private</i> (it will only be visible to organizers).  Similarly, when you create a talk within a seminar, you can mark it as <i>hidden</i> so that it only appears to organizers.  The visibility of a talk will also be affected by its seminar: unhidden talks in a private seminar will only be visible to organizers.  Finally, note that neither seminars nor talks will appear until you're endorsed.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>
        What should I do if I'm organizing a seminar that doesn't meet once a week?
      </h4>
      <p> If it meets every other week on the same day, set the Frequency to 14 in the "Edit properties" page for the seminar.
        If it meets multiple times per week, we don't currently support this (though we plan to in the future).  For now, we suggest changing the "talks per day" field in the Edit Properties page of the seminar to the number of times it meets per week, then editing the date on the schedule page.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>
        I added a topic to my seminar; why aren't the talks in my seminar listed when I filter by that topic?
      </h4>
      Talks inherit the seminar's attributes <i>at the time the talks are created</i> but are not affected by subsequent
      edits to the seminar.  If you want your seminar's new topic to apply to talks previously added to the seminar, 
      you need to add the topic manually to each such talk.  The same applies to other attributes, 
      such as language, room, livestream, and access.
